"""Global UNO component context provider.

Services are singletons that outlive the UNO component that created them.
The ctx passed during bootstrap (from MainJob.__init__) can become stale.

``uno.getComponentContext()`` always returns the current, valid global
context — this is the same call the fallback autostart thread uses.

All services that need UNO access should call ``get_ctx()`` rather than
storing a ctx reference from ``initialize()``.
